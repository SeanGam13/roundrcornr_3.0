# Roundr-Cornr

Roundr-Cornr is more than just a music streaming platformâ€”it's a bridge between upcoming artists and established artists, designed to keep fresh music in people's ears. 

## Inspiration
The idea for Roundr-Cornr was born out of my own struggles as an upcoming artist trying to get my music heard on mainstream streaming platforms. I faced financial constraints that made it difficult to compete for visibility with more established artists. Roundr-Cornr is my way of leveling the playing field and giving talented artists like myself a platform to showcase their work.

## Technical Challenges
Building Roundr-Cornr presented several technical challenges. One of the main challenges was designing a user-friendly interface that would appeal to both artists and listeners. I wanted the platform to be intuitive and easy to navigate, while also incorporating features that would set it apart from other streaming services.

Another challenge was implementing the audio streaming functionality. I had to ensure that the platform could handle a large number of concurrent streams without compromising on audio quality or performance. This required careful optimization of the backend infrastructure and the use of efficient streaming protocols.

## Struggles
I faced several struggles during the development of Roundr-Cornr. One of the biggest struggles was balancing my vision for the platform with the limitations of my technical skills and resources. There were times when I had to scale back certain features or make compromises in order to meet deadlines and stay within budget.

Another struggle was gaining traction and attracting users to the platform. Building a user base from scratch is challenging, especially in a competitive market dominated by big players. I had to be creative in my marketing efforts and focus on building relationships with artists and listeners who shared my vision for Roundr-Cornr.

## Envisioned Next-Iteration
Looking ahead, I envision several improvements and additions for Roundr-Cornr. One of the main areas I want to focus on is enhancing the recommendation algorithm to provide users with more personalized music suggestions. I also want to expand the platform's social features to encourage collaboration and interaction between artists and listeners.

Additionally, I plan to improve the overall user experience by refining the interface and adding new features based on feedback from the community. I believe that continuous iteration and improvement are key to keeping Roundr-Cornr relevant and engaging for users.

## Emotion
Roundr-Cornr is a passion project for me, born out of my love for music and my desire to make a positive impact in the music industry. Every line of code, every design decision, and every feature added to the platform is infused with emotion and a deep sense of purpose. I want Roundr-Cornr to not just be a platform, but a community where artists and listeners can come together to discover, create, and share music in a meaningful way.

## Timeline
Roundr-Cornr has been in development for the past month, starting from the initial concept phase to the final launch. It has been a challenging but rewarding journey, and I am excited to see where it will go next.
